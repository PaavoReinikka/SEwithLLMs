       "'CONTROLLING THE FDR UNDER DEPENDENCY 1169\\nIn Section 2 we discuss in more detail the FDR criterion, the historical\\nbackground of the procedure and available results and review the relevant\\nnotions of positive dependency. This section can be consulted as needed. In\\nSection 3 we outline some important problems where it is natural to assume\\nthat the conditions of Theorem 1.2 hold. In Section 4 we prove the theorem. In the course of the proof we provide an explicit expression for the FDR, from\\nwhich many more new properties can be derived, both for the independent and\\nthe dependent cases.
